1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:09,540
You will find that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.

2
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:20,460
Is this all real? Or is it just happening inside my head?

3
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,420
Of course it's happening inside your head, Harry.

4
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,140
Why should that mean that it's not real?

5
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,540
It's beautiful, isn't it?

6
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,760
I'll never forget the first time I walked through those doors.

7
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,420
I never realized how beautiful this place was.

8
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,920
Yer a wizard, Harry.

9
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,320
I'm a what?

10
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:10,860
The ones that love us never really leave us. And you can always find them...in here.

11
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:25,000
Happiness can be found even in the darkest of times, if only one remembers to turn on the light.

12
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:40,780
Now the pain we all feel, but this dreadful loss reminds me — reminds us — while we may come from different places and speak in different tongues, our hearts beat as one.

13
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:26,540
But remember this. You have friends here. You're not alone.

14
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,120
Feels strange to be going home, doesn't it?

15
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,040
I'm not going home.

16
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,060
Not really.

17
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,900
Help will always be given at Hogwarts, Harry, to those who ask for it,

18
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:59,180
Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who deserve it.
