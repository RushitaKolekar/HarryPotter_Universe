    "summary": "With Voldemort seizing control of the Ministry, Harry, Ron and Hermione abandon Hogwarts to hunt Horcruxes under constant threat. Their perilous journey takes them through wilderness hideouts, a terrifying infiltration of the Ministry (now under fascist rule), and Godric's Hollow where Harry's parents died. Tensions rise as the mysterious Deathly Hallows legend emerges - three objects that together make one master of death. The trio's friendship fractures when the Horcrux locket preys on Ron's insecurities, driving him to abandon the mission. After recovering the Sword of Gryffindor with help from a silver doe Patronus, Harry and Hermione visit Xenophilius Lovegood, learning the Hallows symbol's meaning just as Snatchers capture them. At Malfoy Manor, Bellatrix tortures Hermione while Dobby arrives for a dramatic rescue. The film ends with Voldemort breaking into Dumbledore's tomb to steal the Elder Wand, and our heroes watching in horror as he literally holds the wizarding world's fate in his hands.",
